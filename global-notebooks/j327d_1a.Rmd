Welcome to our first tutorial in R and the start of your programming journey! In this tutorial, you will learn the basic 'grammar' of R

## Objects
In R, we have "objects" (which are like nouns) and "functions" (which are like verbs). Objects can include numbers, characters, strings (as in, a string of characters), booleans, datasets, and more. In R, we create objects using the `<-` arrow (you can also use `=`, but it is not common practice). This is called an assignment.

```{r data-chunk}
an_object <- 1 
```

You can assign a lot of different things to an object. For example, in the above line, we assigned the number `1` to the object `an_object`. When you assign an object, that object is stored in what is called your "Global Environment," which is basically like your storage space.

When you run the above line in R (`an_object <- 1`), you should be able to see a new object in your global enviornment.

You can print the number using the name of the object (in this case, `an_object`). Try it yourself by pressing "run" in the line below:

```{r show-data, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "data-chunk"}
an_object
```

The object we've just created, `an_object` is considered a "numeric" object. You can do math with numeric objects. For example, you can add `10` to the object `an_object` and get a result of 11. Try this out below:

```{r add-exercise, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup="data-chunk"}
an_object + 10
```

Numeric objects differ from character objects, which are like words. You can't add using words, so mathematical operations won't work on character objects. You can tell when an object is a character-type when it starts and ends with quotation marks: `"these are characters."`

```{r newobj, exercise = TRUE}
another_object <- "Han Solo"
another_object
```

It's also important to note that saving a new object with the same name will replace that object. For example, `an_object` is currently a numeric, but we can reassign it new information, like a character.

```{r saving_obj, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "data-chunk"}
an_object

an_object <- "one"
an_object
```

## Functions
Now that we've learned about objects, let's move onto our second concept: functions! If objects are the nouns of the programming language, functions are the verbs. In other words, you do things **to** objects **using** functions.

When you read code in R, you can tell if something is a function because function are always followed by parentheses. So, functions should look like this: `function()`.

Functions typically require the user (you and me!) to provide some information within those parentheses. These are called "arguments" and they tell the computer how to use the function.

For example, say you wanted to get some information about your newly created object (`an_object`). One function that may helpyou is `str()`, which is short for "structure." `class()` takes one argument, the name of the object that you want to get information about. In return, `class()` will tell you what type of data you have (numeric, character, or something else).

Let's use `class()` now to get the class of our object, `an_object`.

```{r classfunction, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup="data-chunk"}
class(an_object)
```

Another function we'll learn about is `summary()`, which can be used to provide a summary of a dataset.

```{r summaryfunction, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup="data-chunk"}
summary(an_object)
```

For numeric objects, `summary()` returns some descriptive information, such as median and mean. This is not super useful if you only have one number in your object (like we do), but it will become more useful as we work with larger datasets.

### 

Before proceeding with learning about packages, I also wanted to make a brief note about comments. We often comment our code to give ourselves notes for the future. In R, we use the `#` sign for these comments.

```{r comment}
#This is a comment
an_object <- 1 #you can also add comments after a line.

#a <- 10 #if you put a #-sign in front of a line of code, R will not run it
```

## Mastering Objects & Functions
"Test your knowledge, we must." - Yoda, probably, if he were a data journalism professor.

```{r quiz-intro, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("How do you assign a value to an object?",
    answer("Use str()"),
    answer("use <-", correct = TRUE),
    answer("use <>"),
    answer("Use the force")
  ),
  question("What sign does R use for comments?",
    answer("#", correct = TRUE),
    answer("."),
    answer("$"),
    answer("%")
  )
)
```
