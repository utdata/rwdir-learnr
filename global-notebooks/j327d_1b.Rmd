## Installing Packages

Many functions we want to use as data journalists often come from "packages," which are collections of functions. Packages often have functions that work together to do something. For example, one package we'll learn about in the future contains a variety of functions for creating graphics, plots, and visuals.

Most of the packages that we will learn in our class are part of a mega-collection of packages called [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). Tidyverse packages are built to work together and contain a lot of great functions for "dealing" with data, including importing it into R, cleaning it up, and using it to make graphics.

There are two steps to using a **new** package. First, you will need to install it. This can be done using the `install.packages()` function. This function takes one argument: the name of the package in quotation marks.

Below is an example of how to use the `install.packages()` function to install tidyverse. Please make sure to do this on your own R Studio environment! 
```{r install-package-function, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

On the next page, we'll learn the second step: loading the package.

## Loading Packages

As we mentioned in the previous page, you only need to install the package once. **But** every time you close and re-open R, you need to load the package back into R. You can do this using the `library()` function. Let's do this now. Notice that in the argument for `library()`, you no longer need to use quotes around the word `tidyverse`.
```{r library-function, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


When you load `tidyverse` using the `library()` function, you may also notice some information provided (like in the image below). As we mentioned, tidyverse is really a collection of packages. The notes provided after using `library(tidyverse)` includes information about the versions of each package and information about which functions have duplicate names.

Now that you've loaded the package, you can now use any functions in the tidyverse packages! Use `?tidyverse` to learn more about the package.

```{r tidyverse-help, eval = FALSE}
?tidyverse
```

In your help tab, you should see something like this:

Remember, you only need to install a package (using `install.packages()`) **once**, but you need to load a package (using `library()`) anytime you open R.


## Mastering Package Installs
```{r quiz-packageinstall, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("When learning about a new package you want to use, should you use install.packages() first or library() first?",
    answer("install.packages()", correct = TRUE),
    answer("library()"),
    answer("Trick question, both are wrong!")
  ),
  question("How often do you need to load a package?",
    answer("Only once"),
    answer("Once a year"),
    answer("Every time I open R", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Never, the package automatically loads")
  )
)
```
