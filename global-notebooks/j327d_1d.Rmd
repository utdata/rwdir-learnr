## Reading Data

As a data journalist, there are many times where you may want to bring data from your computer into your R Global Environment. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to import a table of data using the `tidyverse` package, `readr`!

`readr` is a popular package with functions for importing different types of data (you can learn more about readr [here](https://readr.tidyverse.org/)). The most common one you will likely use is `read_csv()`. The term "csv" is a file type that means ["comma-separated values"](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/comma-delimited/). In a csv format, information (like names, dates, and ages) are separated by commas. This structure can be easily read by most spreadsheet tool, like Excel or Google Sheets, and Excel Spreadsheets/Google Sheets are often exported exported as .csv files. `readr` also contains other functions, though, like `read_excel()` (which is used to import excel spreadsheets specifically) and `read_tsv()` (which is used to import tab-separated files).

Before we proceed with using this package, you need to make sure of two things! First, because `readr` is a `tidyverse` package, you will need to make sure that `tidyverse` is loaded (remember, you only need to install a package once, but you need to load it anytime you open R up).

```{r package, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, you must make sure that the data you want to load is in your working directory. Today, we'll be working with the `toy_data.csv` file, which you can find <here>. When you save this file, make sure that it is stored in your working directory (as a refresher, you can use `getwd()` to figure out your working directory.)

Now that you have done these two things (loaded the tidyverse environment and ensured the `toy_data.csv` file is in your working directory), we can proceed with importing the data.

The function we will use to import this data is `read_csv()`. This function takes one character argument, which is the name of the file in your working directory.

```{r toy-data}
read_csv("toy_data.csv")
```

Great, we can now see the data, right? But if you tried this out on your computer, you'll notice one important thing: even though R displayed the dataset, it hasn't saved it to your Global Environment. Why is that?

```{r quiz-env, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Why hasn't the dataset appeared in our Global Environment",
    answer("We haven't installed the right package."),
    answer("We need to set our working directory."),
    answer("We haven't assigned it to an object.", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```


## Storing Data

If you clicked "We haven't assigned it to an object." in the last question, great job! This is exactly right: for R to store anything, we need to assign it to an object. If you recall, we can do this using `<-`

```{r stored-data}
toy_data <- read_csv("toy_data.csv") #we will name our object toy_data
```

If you rub the above line in your R Studio, you should now see the dataset appear in your global environment (like in the picture below).

Notice that with a dataset like this, R will also provide some information about the number of observations (8) and the number of variables (4).


## Checking out the Data

Let's now learn more about the data we have brought in. One useful function we've learned about already is `summary()`. If you recall, we used summary earlier to get information about a numeric object we created. Let's now use this function to learn more about our `toy_data` object.

```{r summary-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
summary(toy_data)
```

Another useful function is `glimpse()`, which is from the `dplyr` package in `tidyverse`.

```{r glimpse-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
glimpse(toy_data)
```
