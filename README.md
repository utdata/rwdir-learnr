# Reporting with Data - LearnR Lessons

A series of lessons to support Reporting with Data in R course.

## Goals

- Use as few new datasets as possible to focus on the skills instead of learning the data

## Tutorials

- [Intro to Tidyverse](https://utdata.shinyapps.io/rwdir-tidyverse/): This is just a copy from something else. 

## JedR Knight idea

### Flow

- What is the concept?
- How does it work in Star Wars
- Short Quest with Star Wars
- Other data, new Quest
- Answer (hidden)

Frame as "Do, or do not." (Not sure that works well enough)

### Example

- [JedR: Select](https://utdata.shinyapps.io/rwdir-select/): Not a full idea yet
